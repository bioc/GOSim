\title{Set an ontology as base for subsequent computations.}
\description{
   Sets the ontology that all subsequent computations are based on and
   loads the information content of all GO terms within this
   ontology. At load time of the library the default ontology is
   "BP". Furtherm, on running this function the environment GOSimEnv is
   reinitialized, i.e. all global settings or parameters used in the
   library are reset to their default values. 
}
\usage{
setOntology(ont = "BP", loadIC=TRUE, DIR=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ont}{ the ontology to use ("BP","MF","CC") }
  \item{loadIC}{Should the corresponding file with precomputed IC-values be loaded? Default: TRUE. WARNING: If the file is not loaded, no calculations can be performed! This might only be useful, if you want to recalculate IC values.}
  \item{DIR}{If not null, load file from this directory. Otherwise the version installed in GOSim's data directory is used.}
}
\details{
  The following ontologies can be used:
  \describe{
\item{"BP"}{ biological process}
\item{"MF"}{ molecular function}
\item{"CC"}{ cellular component}
}
}
\value{
 none.

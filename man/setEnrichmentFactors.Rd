\title{ Set the depth and densitiy enrichment factors for GO term
  similarity. }
\description{
   Sets the depth and density enrichment factors for the enriched
   FuSSiMeg GO term similarity measure by Couto et al. 
}
\usage{
setEnrichmentFactors(alpha = 0.5, beta = 0.5)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{alpha}{ depth factor }
  \item{beta}{ density factor }
}
\value{
	none

\note{ The enrichment factors are stored internally and are used by the
  function \code{\link{getTermSim}}, if one uses the method
  "CoutoEnriched" to calculate GO term similarities

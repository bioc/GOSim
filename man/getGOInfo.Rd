  Oobtain the GO terms and their description for a list of genes.

\usage{
getGOInfo(geneIDs)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{geneIDs}{ character vector of primary gene IDs according to organism annotation package (see \code{\link{setEvidenceLevel}})}
}
\value{
 List with entry names equal to the gene IDs. Each list contains a
 sublist with entry names equal to the GO terms associated to the
 corresponding gene ID. Each entry also contains a description of the GO
 term, its definition and the ontology ("BP","CC","MF") it belongs to.

\note{ The corresponding information is directly extracted from the "GO"
  library. The result depends on the currently set ontology
  ("BP","MF","CC"), i.e. only GO terms within the actual ontology are
  considered. The shown GO information refers to the actually installed GO library.
